The object of the mini-project was to develop a scalable, AI-powered system that detects fraud in real-time financial transactions, enhancing security, reducing financial losses, and fostering customer trust.  This was achieved through: -

•	Efficient Financial Transactions Data Storage: by using MySQL to create a relational database for securely storing transaction data, ensuring data consistency and easy access.

•	Data Processing with Big Data Tools: through the utilization of Apache Spark framework to efficiently process large-scale transaction data, enabling faster analysis and model training.

•	Machine Learning Model Development: using Python to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent and detect anomalies.

•	Features Engineering and Analysis: by identifying and engineering relevant features from financial transaction data to enhance model accuracy.

•	Data Visualization and Reporting: using Microsoft Power BI and Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly) to visualize data trends, model performance, and detect fraud patterns for stakeholders.

•	Continuous Model Improvement: by implementing a feedback loop to update the model with new fraud cases, ensuring adaptability to emerging fraud tactics.
